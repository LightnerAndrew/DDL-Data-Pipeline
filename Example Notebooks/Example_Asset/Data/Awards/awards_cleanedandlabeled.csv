A field crew member was injured while working as a guide for the dump trucks transporting soil from the SA into the IPTD. The crew member’s right thumb was caught between the tailgate and the bed of the dump truck while the tailgate was closing, pinching the thumb and causing it to bleed. The injury was cleaned and dressed, and the crew member was taken to the local hospital for an x-ray to assure that no internal injuries had occurred. The crew member was back to work with no loss work time reported.

Approximately 3 cubic meters of soil spilled out onto the ramp. The H&S crews and support team immediately closed the ramp and cleaned up the affected area.","In the afternoon of July 9, a severe thunderstorm came through Danang. Turbid stormwater flowed out from the IPTD structure through the southern entrance of the pile, through the concrete blocks and onto the gravel at the south end of the structure. Control measures (rock check dam and silt fencing) were instituted immediately after the spill was identified. Crews removed gravel from the areas where the spill occurred on July 10, 2013 and placed it into the pile for treatment. Tetra Tech removed surficial fill in areas affected by the spill and created a spill report. A 30-point composite sample was collected from the area affected by the spill and contained 124 ppt Total Dioxin TEQ. This result is below our the cleanup level of 150 ppt Total Dioxin TEQ for sediment and indicates that the contaminated material was effectively removed from the area.",,,-8,1,-8,1,-8,-8,1,1,Project-wide HASP and EMMP provided under construction oversight award.,-8,1,10,,-8,1,1,1,10,,-8,,1,1,,-8,-8,-8,-8,-8,-8,-8,-8,-8,-8,-8,,-8,-8,-8,-8,-8,-8,-8

IMPORTANT NOTE: Scope of Contract: This is NOT a construction contract. The contract is predominantly for health commodity procurement. Renovation of warehouses is necessary to safeguard stock and ensure they are well racked, secured and stored in temperature controlled environment. All the renovation works under this contract were applied to already existing structures. Renovation is limited to racking, shelving, installation of A/C, installation of security systems, management information systems, and other interior improvements. NO work was done that changed the footprint of a building OR the outside awnings, raising roofs, outside ramp changes, outside paved walkways, anything to do with concrete (including demolition of concrete), drains that require digging or drilling, and/or foundation for drains and fencing. Pre-Fabricated Structures: We have procured turn-key pre-fabricated warehouses and clinics.
