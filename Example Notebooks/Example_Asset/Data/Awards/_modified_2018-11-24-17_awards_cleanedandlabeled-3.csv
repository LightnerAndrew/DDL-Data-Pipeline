A MWCT wildlife ranger and a Ugandan Terrain construction company employee were shot and killed while walking to the construction site. A South Sudan Police investigation along with WCS and MWCT enquiries confirmed this report. It was suspected that the perpetrators were from roaming armed tribal groups, which are known to raid and rob people in that sector. Following the incident the construction company suspended its operations for two weeks, and the MWCT deployed additional security forces to the site.

Approximately 3 cubic meters of soil spilled out onto the ramp. The H&S crews and support team immediately closed the ramp and cleaned up the affected area.","In the afternoon of July 9, a severe thunderstorm came through Danang. Turbid stormwater flowed out from the IPTD structure through the southern entrance of the pile, through the concrete blocks and onto the gravel at the south end of the structure. Control measures (rock check dam and silt fencing) were instituted immediately after the spill was identified. Crews removed gravel from the areas where the spill occurred on July 10, 2013 and placed it into the pile for treatment. Tetra Tech removed surficial fill in areas affected by the spill and created a spill report. A 30-point composite sample was collected from the area affected by the spill and contained 124 ppt Total Dioxin TEQ. This result is below our the cleanup level of 150 ppt Total Dioxin TEQ for sediment and indicates that the contaminated material was effectively removed from the area.",,,-8,1,-8,1,-8,-8,1,1,Project-wide HASP and EMMP provided under construction oversight award.,-8,1,10,,-8,1,1,1,10,,-8,,1,1,,-8,-8,-8,-8,-8,-8,-8,-8,-8,-8,-8,,-8,-8,-8,-8,-8,-8,-8
