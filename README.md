DDL Data-Pipline 
================

This package eases the process of working with the Socrata API via python.  The process relies heavily on the [socrata-py](https://github.com/socrata/socrata-py) package for the standard operations of creating datasets and the [Socrata Publisher API](https://socratapublishing.docs.apiary.io/#introduction/examples) for adding non-standard metadata and adding USAID Data Assets .
